# EduGuard

EduGuard is a **facial recognition-based attendance system** designed to monitor student presence in classrooms. It uses real-time face detection to verify whether students are present during scheduled class times. When a student is detected outside class during class hours, the system sends an alert to administrators. EduGuard is an intelligent way to automate attendance tracking and ensure accountability in educational environments.
